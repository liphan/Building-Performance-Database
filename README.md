# Building Performance Benchmarking

This project is a benchmarking tool for Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) of a selected building type (eg. Education) at a selected location 
(eg. Oregon).

This tool can be used prior to constructing a new building, or retrofitting an existing building.

Based on building location, type and feature, this project identifies other similar existing buildings in the same location and analyses the aggregate EUI for benchmarking.
