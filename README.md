# Building Performance Benchmarking


This project is a benchmarking tool for Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) of a selected building type (eg. Education) at a selected location 
(eg. Oregon). Unit of EUI is kBTU/ft2/year.


This tool can be used prior to constructing a new building, or retrofitting an existing building.


Based on building location, type and feature, this project identifies other similar existing buildings in the same location and analyses the aggregate EUI for benchmarking.


_bpd_api_practice.py_ - query data from Building Performance Database and then store the result from each state as one csv file in local computer

_combine_states.py_ - combine all csv files into combine_states.csv

_explore_1.ipynb_ - explore the result / data in combine_states.csv
